# v1.1.4-beta.10

## 🎨 UI Refinements
- **Ping Indicator Position**: Moved the status check indicator (ping dot) from the bottom-right to the **top-right** corner of bookmark cards. This improves visibility and consistency with other UI elements.

## 🐛 Fixes
- **Dashboard Grid**: Minor CSS adjustments ensuring the new indicator position doesn't interfere with interaction elements in normal view mode.
