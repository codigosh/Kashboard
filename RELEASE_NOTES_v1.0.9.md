# Kashboard v1.0.9 Release Notes

This release focuses on optimizing the experience for tablet and high-resolution touch users.

## 📱 Tablet & Mobile Improvements

*   **Clean Tablet View:**
    *   **Hidden Widgets:** Widgets are now hidden on tablets and mobile devices to reduce clutter and focus on quick access to bookmarks.
    *   **Simplified Toolbar:** The top bar on tablets now hides the generic "Edit", "Add", and "Preferences" toggles, showing only the Search icon, matching the streamlined mobile interface.
    *   **Touch Detection:** Improved device detection logic to correctly identify high-resolution touch devices (like iPad Pro) using pointer events, ensuring the optimized view is applied consistently.
