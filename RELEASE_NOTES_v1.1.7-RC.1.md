# Release Notes: v1.1.7-RC.1

## 🚀 Release Candidate 1
- **Versioning Fix**: Moved from `Beta` to `RC` (Release Candidate) to resolve an issue where some updaters detected `Beta.10+` as older than `Beta.9` due to lexicographical sorting.
- **Stability**: Contains all fixes from Beta 14 (Bootstrap Refinement, Storage Sanitizer, Mobile Logic).
- **Status**: Production Ready Candidate.
