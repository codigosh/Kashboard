## 🔢 Systematic Beta Channel
- **Versioning**: Implemented zero-padded beta numbering (.05) to ensure correct chronological sorting on GitHub Releases.
- **Update Logic**: Fixed backend bug where 'RC' versions were considered older than 'Beta' due to case sensitivity.
- **Auto-Detection**: Unstable versions now automatically check the beta channel for updates.
