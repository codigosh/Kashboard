# Kashboard v1.0.8 Release Notes

This release focuses on refining the mobile user experience by eliminating visual glitches.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

*   **Mobile Duplicate Fix:**
    *   Resolved an issue where bookmarks appeared duplicated on mobile devices.
    *   The "flattened" mobile view now correctly filters out section containers, ensuring only the actual bookmarks and widgets are displayed once in the unified grid.
